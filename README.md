# CMU-Painting
Simple game where you control a character with your cursor and must avoid incoming mines!

This code was meant to run inside a sandbox environment provided by [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu). The library is included with this project, and should work similar, if not the same to the website environment.

# HOW TO PLAY
The "Player" (The Circle) will follow your mouse at all times.
Waves of increasingly quicker & larger mines come your way, you must avoid these mines at all costs.
Every 4 difficulty (or score) increase will increase your amount of boosts by 1. When you have a boost, you may left click to activate invulnerability for a short moment.
Good Luck!

# NOTE
This was coded for the CMU Graphics environment on the CMU website. It will not work outside of it even with the cmu desktop graphics.
